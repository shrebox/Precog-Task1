  <h2>1. Data extraction using the data.py script:</h2>
  Using the Twitter API with Tweepy wrapper, data has been extracted for a particular hashtag. I have  collected data for 10001 tweets for Mumbai Rains and 12400 for Delhi/NCR Pollution. 
  
  To use the script, in terminal run the following command:
 <b> $ python data.py</b>
  * You have put Twitter API keys for extraction.

  <h2>2. Webapp for the data analysis:</h2>
  Data analysis script: "my2.py" is stored in the Codes directory which is further analysed using various visualizations using Google Charts.
  Webapp is hosted on: <b>https://youtube-analysis-precogtask.herokuapp.com/</b>
